Version 1.5.10 - 2 September 2007
 - added new options to createBeadSummaryData (see "method" and "trim"
 arguments) to allow mean, median, trimmed mean or winsorized means to 
 be calculated to summarise the values from each beat type on an array.  
 createBeadSummaryData.c code edited to allow new options
 - "which" argument changed to "what" in getArrayData().  Also added new
 arguments ("method" and "trim") for use by createBeadSummaryData when 
 what="residG", "residR" or "residM" to allow control over summarisation 
 methods. Updated arguments of getArrayData() when called in other bead 
 level plotting functions.
 - Added new arguments to boxplotBeads, imageplot, plotBeadDensities, etc 
 to accept these new arguments to getArrayData (when whatToPlot="residG", 
 "residR" or "residM")
 - added FILL=TRUE to read.table() used in readBeadSummaryData() in response
 to message on BioC list from Ina Hoeschele about error trying to read in 
 BeadStudio version 3 data caused by line having incorrect number of entries
 - updated help pages

Version 1.5.9 - 1 August 2007
 - changed default quote argument in readBGX() to quote="" (i.e. disabled)
 - updated readBGX() man page

Version 1.5.8 - 31 July 2007
 - normaliseIllumina.RD added
 - spelling mistake in message in readIllumina() corrected
 - corrected plot orientation and setting of zlims in imageplot()
 - corrected plot orientation in plotBeadLocations()
 - createBeadSummaryData() NA or Inf values replaced by 0 when log=TRUE/FALSE (previously only occurred when log=TRUE)
 - plotBeadDensities() now allows different colours for each channel plotted


Version 1.5.7 - 23 July 2007
 - normaliseIllumina, offers normalisation for ExpressionSetIllumina objects
 - readBeadSummaryData, default options changed to handle BeadStudio 3 output (skip=8, added 'quote=""' to read.table (default 'quote'
 caused R to hang for some BeadStudio version 3 output))
 sep arguments to be correct for version 3 outputetc.)
 - vsn2 used in normalizeSingleArray, instead of vsn
 - displayTIFFImage and plotCoord removed
 - plotMA and plotXY updated to now check for and exclude missing values from plotting
 - createBeadSummaryData now checks that the arrays it combines (when 'imagesPerArray=2') are the right ones.  New argument 'what', which allows log-ratios (M), average intensites (A), red (R), green (G) or red and green (RG) intensities to be summarised.  Default 'imagesPerArray' set to 1 instead of 2.
 - getArrayData:  typos in error messages fixed.  New 'which' option 'residM'
 top get residuls from log-ratios.
 - readIllumina: default background correction option changed to 'subtract'
 - imageplot: changed default nrow and ncol to 100 (was 18 and 2 respectively)
 - beadResids() simplified after changes to getArrayData
 - updated man pages


Version 1.3.1 - 12 Feb 2007

BeadLevelList
 - changed structure to accommodate varying numbers of beads per array
 - new slots 'beadData' (environment) which stores raw data in data.frames,
 one for each array, 'phenoData' (AnnotatedDataFrame) to store targets/sample 
 information, 'arrayInfo' (list) which stores array names, number of beads 
 and other array information, and 'scanMetrics' which stores scanner setting 
 information
 - updated plotting functions to handle data in new structure
 - updated createBeadSummaryData to handle new structure

New functions
 - plotRG, for two-colour data
 - boxplotBeads, to do boxplots of the raw intensities
 - getArrayData, numBeads, arrayNames for use on BeadLevelList data

Changes to C code
 - commented out 'bead is too close to edge, ignoring' warning in readBeadimages
 - changed default setting of BLImagePlot to take log2 of the data passed to it
 - findAllOutliers now takes 'nmads' argument to select outliers
 - createBeadSummary also accepts 'nmads'

Data
 - new BLData object (4 arrays from a SAM)
